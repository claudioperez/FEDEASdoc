 FEDEASLab Basic Toolbox for Structural Analysis
 Version 5.0                           July 2018
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 Structural Analysis functions (Basic version)
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  The zip file contains functions in two folders: Basic and Utilities;
  these folders should be placed on the Matlab search path so that the functions
  in the folders can be invoked from any folder on the hard disk.
  Most functions in the Basic folder have extension (.m) and are readable, because they
  present concepts of the basic course and may be of interest to students.
  The functions in the folder Utilities have extension (.p) and are not accessible
  to avoid distraction with details irrelevant to the understanding of course concepts.
  To add a folder to the Matlab path select Set Path from the Matlab Home Menu,
  then Add Folder, select the folder and click ok.
  There are two more folders in the zip file: Help and Examples. The Help folder
  contains Help files for all functions accessible by clicking on FEDEASLab.html.
  The Examples folder contains the scripts for many examples of the course reader.
  The functions work with Matlab R2016b and later and will not work with earlier versions.

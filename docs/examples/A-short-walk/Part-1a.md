Inelasticity in Frame Sections
==============================

In this section, the response of a nonlinear cross section is analyzed,
which is assumed to represent a thin slice of a frame member, for which
fiber strains can be considered constant.

### Solution stability under perfect plasticity

![Figure 1: Moment-curvature response with minimal
hardening.`\label{mc1}`{=tex}](docs/img/p1/moment-curvature-1.png){#fig:mc1}

fig.Â 1 presents the moment-curvature response for the first two cases,
which utilize perfectly-pastic and effectively plastic ($H_k = 10^{-9}$)
materials, respectively. Additionally, this figure tracks the movement
of the neutral axis location throughout the moment curvature analysis
for runs `\ref{run:P1-0}`{=tex} and `\ref{run:P1-1}`{=tex}. At each load
step, this location is calculated according to the following relation:

$$y_{NA} = \dfrac{\epsilon_{ref, i}}{\kappa_i} - y_{ref}$$

Where $\epsilon_{ref, i}$ is the axial strain measured at the current
reference axis location, $y_{ref}$.

  abstract = {An accurate and efficient analytical model describing the hysteretic behavior of R/C beam-column joints subjected to random cyclic excitations is presented. The model takes into account the cyclic bond deterioration along anchored bars as well as the hysteretic behavior of cracked R/C sections at beam-column interfaces, thus allowing consideration of the interaction between the two end sections of the joint.},

  abstract = {A stress‐strain model is developed for concrete subjected to uniaxial compressive loading and confined by transverse reinforcement. The concrete section may contain any general type of confining steel: either spiral or circular hoops; or rectangular hoops with or without supplementary cross ties. These cross ties can have either equal or unequal confining stresses along each of the transverse axes. A single equation is used for the stress‐strain equation. The model allows for cyclic loading and includes the effect of strain rate. The influence of various types of confinement is taken into account by defining an effective lateral confining stress, which is dependent on the configuration of the transverse and longitudinal reinforcement. An energy balance approach is used to predict the longitudinal compressive strain in the concrete corresponding to first fracture of the transverse reinforcement by equating the strain energy capacity of the transverse reinforcement to the strain energy stored in the concrete as a result of the confinement.},
